# Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship. Each project has its own folder with containing the project details, code, and results.

## Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data

In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis on retail sales data to gain insights into the sales patterns and customer behavior. I used various data visualization techniques to represent the data and identify trends, patterns, and outliers. You can find the project report [here](project1/README.md).

## Project 2: Customer Segmentation

The objective of this project was to segment the customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic information. I used various clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering to segment the customers. The project report is available [here](project2/README.md).

## Project 3: Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is an essential step in any data analysis project. In this project, I demonstrated the data cleaning process using various techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers. You can find the project report [here](project3/README.md).

## Project 4: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

In this project, I built a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, and location. I evaluated the model's performance using various metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. The project report is available [here](project4/README.md).

## Project 5: Wine Quality Prediction

The objective of this project was to predict the quality of wine based on various features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, and sulphates. I used various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to build the predictive model. The project report is available [here](project5/README.md).

You can find the complete list of projects and their details in the [project list](project_list.md) available on my GitHub repository.
